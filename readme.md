2. A browser permissions dialog will appear
3. Click "Allow" to grant the following permissions:
   - `activeTab`: For capturing screenshots and environment detection
   - `downloads`: For saving screenshots
   - `scripting`: For full page screenshots and environment detection
   - `clipboardWrite`: For copying bug reports
   - `storage`: For form data persistence (required permission)

#### Troubleshooting Permissions

If features aren't working:
1. Click the ‚öôÔ∏è button to check current permissions
2. If permissions are missing, you'll be prompted to grant them
3. Use the ‚Üª (refresh) button to reload the extension after granting permissions
4. If problems persist, try:
   - Closing and reopening the extension
   - Refreshing the current page
   - Checking your browser's extension settings

#### Permission Details
- **Screenshots**: Requires `activeTab` and `downloads`
- **Environment Detection**: Requires `activeTab` and `scripting`
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Requires `clipboardWrite`
- **Form Saving**: Uses `storage` (automatically granted)

> **Note**: All permissions can be revoked through your browser's extension settings if needed. The extension will prompt you to re-grant permissions when you try to use features that require them.
